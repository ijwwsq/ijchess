whats the point of this project?

im just trying to implement my own chess engine for future model-learning

the goal is to create complete self-written engine, and after that i want to create a model, that can calculate some good moves

its very poorly written code, but im not making science, im making party

---

so 'R' is white rook 'r' is black rook, thats the logic

todo: 
- each piece in separate file (?)
- calculate points for capture
- move figures
