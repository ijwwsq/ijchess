whats the point of this project?

im just trying to implement my own chess engine for future model-learning

the goal is to create complete self-written engine, and after that i want to create a model, that can calculate some good moves

its very poorly written code, but im not making science, im making party

---

so 'R' is white rook 'r' is black rook, thats the logic

something is wrong with en passant

---
for neural network minimax is really good choise, like
The maximin value is the highest value that the player can be sure to get without knowing the actions of the other players; equivalently, it is the lowest value the other players can force the player to receive when they know the player's action.
